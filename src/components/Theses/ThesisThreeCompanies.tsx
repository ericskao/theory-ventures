            The initial wave of Blockchains commercialized systems that proved the core tenets of
            crypto: applications could be built on decentralized, trustless infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            As usage blossomed, developers sought ways of increasing database speed & reducing
            transaction costs of writing to blockchains, especially on Ethereum, where transaction
            costs can be significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arbitrum launched their Layer 2 technology which records transactions at a 90% reduction
            in cost to Ethereum, commercializing research from Princeton on multi-party computation,
            the core cryptographical advance powering many blockchains.

            Only a few thousand developers work publishing web3 applications today. The programming
            languages, Solidity & Rust, are infrastructure languages, far less common than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facebook's Diem project sought to move the web3 community to a novel language, Move,
            that resembles more popular languages to simplify the learning curve. At the same time,
            Move provides formal verification, guaranteeing a program acts the way it was designed,
            critically important for applications moving significant sums.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diem also embraced an architecture that parallelized transactions to scale, an
            architectural shift that reduces transaction costs to fractions of a penny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mysten is a blockchain founded by the Diem team that uses the Move language on this new
            parallelized architecture.

            Blockchains publish their data in the public realm. Every curious person can validate a
            transaction completed or a certain wallet owns a particular asset.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that data can be confusing. Syntactic differences between chains & insider
            knowledge known initially amongst a small community needs to be shared for many to
            benefit from public data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dune has cultivated a community of hundreds of thousands of wizards who analyze public
            crypto data called Wizards, simplify the complexity with Spells, & publish those data in
            dashboards.
